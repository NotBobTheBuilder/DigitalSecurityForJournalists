Finally, a good deal of security comes from taking simple, physical
precautions. Get a privacy screen for your laptop, and keep an eye out
for “shoulder surfers”. Put a Post-it over your laptop and phone cameras
when you’re not actively using them, and never let your devices out of
your sight or loan them to anyone. The one exception to this may be in
cases where you are meeting a source in person: Rather than turning your
phone off, leave it at home or at work.
